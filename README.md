# 🐉Afrodita-DiT is a text-driven DiT implementation, I hope you like it :b

## Train File test with MNIST is ``` TrainDiT2TestMnist.py ```

Terminal:  
``` 
python TrainDiT2TestMnist.py  --batch-size 4 --epochs 10
```
If you have a 24GB graphics card you can train with it with these settings:

``` 
python TrainDiT2TestMnist.py  --batch-size 48 --epochs 10
```
